6,Disassembly Protection,How well is the product protected from cosmetic damage during disassembly?,Design for Disassembly,"Opening requires high heat or heavy prying that guarantees cosmetic damage (warping, scratches) or risks cracking glass/screens just to get inside.","Once the shell is opened, there are exposed ribbon cables or delicate sensors immediately under the seam. A prying tool slipping by 2mm could sever a critical connection.","Design includes ""pick-start"" notches or specific gaps for tools. Internal components are slightly recessed, but there are still no physical barriers to stop a tool from over-penetrating.","Features internal ""stoppers"" or mechanical bumpers. Even if a tool slips, it hits a plastic or metal frame rather than a sensitive component. Connectors are reinforced or tucked away from the perimeter.","No tools are required, making accidental internal or cosmetic damage virtually impossible.",,,,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,Renewable Material Inputs,"Consider the materials listed in the CMF design spec. Renewable materials include post-consumer and post-industrial recycling. Biobased materials can also be considered if they are widely recycled (PP, PE, PS, HIPS, ABS grades) or seperated for biodegrading. ",Material Inputs,No renewable material inputs,Renewable material inputs limited. Some colors and materials are still virgin to match the CMF direction,PCR Pool is leveraged to maximize the renewable material content of all CMF design parts. ,"Project leads the way by qualifying a new material with higher renewable material content or unlocking a new color or capability at an existing best in class material.

10,Material Durability,"Think about which materials will wear first. Often this is where a user touches, holds or interacts with the product. This relates both to the material and texture selection. Consider the worst performing colorway, often white. ",Longevity,"Materials are likely to age, stain or show wear within 90 days","Materials will not age, stain or show wear in the first 2 years of heavy use","Materials will not age, stain or show wear in the first 3 years of heavy use","Materials will not age, stain or show wear in the first 5 years of heavy use",Materials will never age or will do so in a way that increases the value,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,TRUE,,
11,Cleaning,Keeping your device clean and fresh is a great way to extend the life and encourage users to keep their devices for longer.,Longevity,"Dirt Traps. Design features deep, narrow seams, ""stepped"" parts, or open speaker grilles that catch skin cells/dust. Materials (like soft-touch rubber) react poorly to isopropyl alcohol, becoming sticky or discolored.","Surface-Only Clean. Most flat areas are wipeable, but buttons and ports have ""shrouded"" gaps that require a toothpick or compressed air to clean. Not water-resistant; a damp cloth risks internal damage.","Optimized Geometry. Tighter tolerances minimize seam gaps. Materials are rated for common household cleaners. Features ""flush"" buttons or touch-capacitive surfaces that eliminate physical crevices.","Sanitization-Ready. The device has a high IP rating (IP67+), allowing it to be rinsed under a tap.

13,Dismantling,Materials have to be separated for recycling. This question asks how easily those materials can be separated by typical recycling machines such as shredders and hammers.,Recycling,More than half of the material weight is glued together or otherwise permanently bonded,Only technically required areas have permanent bonding,"Materials that are not widely recycled, such as fabrics or elastomers, designed for quick and easy separation from the product before destructive dismantling",There is no permanent bonding of dissimilar materials but screws are still used for construction resulting in some material lose when shredding,"There is no permanent bonding of dissimilar materials. The assembly is either mono-material or dissimilar materials are designed to separate when shredded (snaps, clips, etc.).",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE

15,Plastic Material Finishes,Labels and coatings can prevent separation or inhibit plastic sorting. IML or labels in the same material as the base part is acceptable. Labels attached with a non-silicone based or water soluble adhesive are considered recyclable. Darker colors inhibit sorting as it is difficult for the technology to see and it may result in it being rejected from the recycling process. Lighter colors have a greater chance of making it to the PCR plastic market because the color palette can be changed.  ,Recycling,"Plastic parts are painted and/or covered in labels, IML, PVD or paint",Plastic are painted only if there is a functional requirement such as backlit keyboard keys,All plastic parts are free of paint or coatings,All plastic parts are also free of non-recyclable labels,"All plastics are in natural, ready to recycle colors. No dark color SKUs in the product plan.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
16,User Guidance,Encouraging the user to properly dispose of their device at the end of life is critical to the circular journey of our products. ,Recycling,No user guidance beyond legal requirement,Recycling and/or take back website linked on packaging,Recycling and/or take back website linked on product,Recycling and/or take back incentives on product,"Full product passport showing the origin, value and next life plans for the product's materials",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
